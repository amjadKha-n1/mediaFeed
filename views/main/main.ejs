        <p class="intro-text">
            Social Feed is a simple text-based social media platform where users can
            share their thoughts, connect with others, and explore content from the
            community in a clean and distraction-free environment.

            <h2>What is Social Feed?</h2>
            <p>
                Social Feed is inspired by platforms like Twitter, but it focuses only
                on text-based posts. There are no images or videos — just meaningful
                conversations and ideas.

            <h2>Purpose of This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The main goal of Social Feed is to learn and understand how a real
                social media platform works behind the scenes — including user
                authentication, database relationships, and dynamic content rendering.
